/*
 * Generic implementation of a clock cycle timer, used by the peripherals TCx, WDT, RTC
 * It is structured with two consecutive stages:
 *  - Prescaler
 *  - Timer
 *  The prescaler works as a counter of simulated clock cycles, starting at 0,
 *  wrapping at 'ps_max', and generating timer 'ticks' once every 'ps_factor' cycles.
 *  The timer generates a timeout signal after a delay given in prescaler ticks.
 *  The class doesn't not have any tick counter as such. it only generates ticks that user objects
 *  can use to increment or decrement a counter. The meaning of the timeout signal is also left
 *  to users.
 *  The timeout is transmitted though a AVR_Signal, available via 'signal()' and raised in 2 ways:
 *   - When the programmed timeout delay is reached
 *   - When 'update()' is called, and enough clock cycles have passed, resulting in at least one tick.
 *  If the nb of ticks is enough to reach the set delay, the signal data index is set to 1.
 *  Otherwise, data.index is set to 0 and data.u is set to the available tick count.
 *  Timers can be daisy-chained, so that the prescaler output of a timer feeds into the
 *  prescaler of another.
